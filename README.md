I used a series of timers to take users though a set of 
trivia questions. The user has 30 seconds to respond to each question. 
The game will display a particular gif from a specific array based on 
the user's response. 
At the end of the game the score will be displayed and a button will 
appear that will allow the user to resart the game.
